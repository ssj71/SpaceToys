SpaceToys is a VR game built in Godot 3.2 for oculus quest.
It offers a 3rd person arcade shooter experience inspired by 
Valve's Xortex 26XX minigame from the Lab.

All code is GPL licensed unless otherwise noted in the subdirectory 
(such as the OQ_Toolkit) and art assets are licensed individually by 
their respective owners (see below for attributions). All art was found 
at opengameart.org.

To build this you are expected to be familiar with Godot, in which case you
probaby don't need any instructions, though I'll try to support you where 
I can.
