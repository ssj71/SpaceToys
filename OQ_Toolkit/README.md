# Godot Oculus Quest Toolkit <!-- omit in toc --> 
This is an early alpha version of a toolkit for basic VR interactions with the Oculus Quest using the Godot game engine.
The toolkit in this repository requires (at the time of writing) a recent version of Godot 3.2.
If you have questions or run into problems please open an issue here or contact me at the [official Godot Discord](https://discord.gg/zH7NUgz): @NeoSpark314 or in the #XR channel.

## Showcases
A list of some projects and prototypes that use the Oculus Quest Toolkit that I'm aware of. If you are using the toolkit and would like to be here you can ping me or open an issue and I will add it.

# Documentation
The documentation is in the [project wiki](https://github.com/NeoSpark314/godot_oculus_quest_toolkit/wiki). It includes
a more detailed getting started section and an overview of the included features.

## Known issues

As this is a very early version there are some known issues that are not yet resolved. If you know a solution feel free to open a github issue to further discuss it or catch me on the [official Godot Discord](https://discord.gg/zH7NUgz): @NeoSpark314.

- No shader precompilation/caching. This means there will be a **very** noticeable hiccup when new objects/materials are rendered for the first time (like showing the UI pointer or when transitioning scenes). This will be essential to resolve for actual applications!
- No mip-mapping for UI canvas (thus text looks very bad at some distance)


## Planned features

There are a lot of potential extensions and missing features. Some of the things I think I will tackle next are on this list; but if you have some other suggestions feel free to open an issue to discuss it.

- Teleport movement option
- Jumping of ledges while climbing
- Grabbed objects
  - handing over objects
  - interaction trigger
- Improvements to the labeling system
- Physics interactors (levers, rotators, buttons, maybe doors)
